Collection of tools to accelerate local development

# Prerequisites

You only need to install two things properly on your host machine. Everything else is automated.

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

When installing Vagrant, make sure you install a version that is new enough to match the version of VirtualBox installed.
